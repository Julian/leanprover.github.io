The *Lean Theorem Prover* aims to bridge the gap between interactive
and automated theorem proving, by situating automated tools and
methods in a framework that supports user interaction and the
construction of fully specified axiomatic proofs. The goal is to
support both mathematical reasoning and reasoning about complex
systems, and to verify claims in both domains.
