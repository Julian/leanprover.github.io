Lean and its libraries are still under development, but you can build it from the source code.

- [Source Code](http://github.com/leanprover/lean)

You will need [Emacs24](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) (or later). For more information on configuring Emacs and
installing unicode-friendly fonts, see
[here](https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/src/emacs/README.md).
