You can experiment with Lean by running an
[online](https://leanprover.github.io/live/) Javascript version in
your browser. If you have installed Lean locally, you can use it
interactively with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or
[Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). See the
[Using Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/reference/using_lean.html)
chapter of the reference manual for details.

Lean is a work in progress. You are welcome to experiment with it, but please
recognize that the system is still changing, and if you are looking
for stability, it may not be the system for you. Similarly, the project
cannot accommodate feature requests at this stage. If you are trying to decide
whether to invest time in learning to use Lean right now, this
[FAQ](https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/doc/faq.md) may be helpful.

The following tutorial is available in an online version that
runs alongside a Lean in your browser, and as a PDF document.

- *Theorem Proving in Lean*<br />
  A introduction to using Lean as an interactive theorem prover. <br />
  [online tutorial](../theorem_proving_in_lean),
  [pdf](../theorem_proving_in_lean/theorem_proving_in_lean.pdf)<br />

## Chat Room

A public chat room dedicated to Lean is open on [Zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/).
