The current version of Lean is Lean 3, and is under active
development. The source code and libraries can be found on
[github](http://github.com/leanprover/lean).

- [Lean Fundamentals](fundamentals)
- [Using Lean with Emacs](emacs)

## Tutorials

Each of the following tutorials is available in an online version that
runs alongside a Lean in your browser, and as a PDF document.

- *An Introduction to Lean.*<br />
  A quick tour of Lean and its features.<br /> 
  [online tutorial](../introduction_to_lean),
  [pdf](../introduction_to_lean/introduction_to_lean.pdf)<br />

- *Theorem Proving in Lean.*<br />
  A introduction to using Lean as an interactive theorem prover. <br /> 
  [online tutorial](../theorem_proving_in_lean),
  [pdf](../theorem_proving_in_lean/theorem_proving_in_lean.pdf)<br />

- *Programming in Lean*<br />
  An introduction to writing and reasoning about programs in Lean, as well as
  writing tactics and automation.<br /> 
  [online tutorial](../programming_in_lean),
  [pdf](../programming_in_lean/programming_in_lean.pdf) <br />
  
*Caveat.* All three are incomplete and under construction.

## Lean 2

The previous version of Lean is still being maintained but not
developed. Lean 2 has special support for homotopy type theory and a
substantial library. The source code and libraries can be found on
[github](http://github.com/leanprover/lean2).

- *Theorem Proving in Lean.*<br />
  The version for Lean 2.<br />
